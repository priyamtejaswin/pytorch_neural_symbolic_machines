> Forked from [Pytorch Neural Symbolic Machines repo](https://github.com/priyamtejaswin/pytorch_neural_symbolic_machines). I wanted to understand how NSM/program-synthesis is implemented. To that end, I'll be adding support for [WikiSQL](https://github.com/salesforce/WikiSQL) to my fork.

# Pytorch Neural Symbolic Machines

This repository is a Pytorch implementation of Google's [neural symbolic machines](https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines) model (Liang et al., 2018) for weakly-supervised semantic parsing. Specifically, we implement the [memory augmented policy optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02322) (MAPO) algorithm for reinforcement learning of semantic parsers on the [WikiTableQuestions](https://nlp.stanford.edu/blog/wikitablequestions-a-complex-real-world-question-understanding-dataset/) environment. This codebase is used in [Yin et al. (2020)](xxx).

**Key Difference with the Official TensorFlow Implementation** This implementation 
differs from the official tensorflow implementation in the following ways:

* The original model uses GloVe word embeddings and bi-directional LSTM networks as the encoder of utterances and table schemas (table columns). This implementation uses **pre-trained BERT/[TaBERT models](http://fburl.com/TaBERT)** using the table representation strategy proposed in Yin et al. (2020). It significantly outperforms the LSTM-based model, registering **~49.4%** denotation-level exact-match accuracies on the test set (the original accuracy is 43.8).
* We revised the [data pre-processing script](https://github.com/crazydonkey200/neural-symbolic-machines/blob/master/table/wtq/preprocess.py), and re-processed the WikiTableQuestions dataset. We also turned off the `--anonymize_datetime_and_number_entities` option when preprocessing the dataset, which gave better performance.
* Besides performance improvement, we also optimized the original codebase for general efficiency improvement. The training speed is ~2 times faster than the original tensorflow implemenation when using an LSTM encoder.

## Setup

**Install TaBERT** The BERT representation learning layer depends on the [TaBERT model](http://fburl.com/TaBERT), which is a pre-trained language model for learning representations of natural language utterances and semi-structured Web tables. Please install TaBERT following the instructions at [here](http://fburl.com/TaBERT).

**Conda Environment** Next, update the `tabert` conda environment shipped with `TaBERT` with dependencies of this project:

```bash
conda env update --name tabert --file data/env.yml
```

**Download Dependencies** We provide a pre-processed version of the `WikiTableQuestions` dataset, which could be downloaded from:

```
wget http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pengchey/pytorch_nsm.zip
unzip pytorch_nsm.zip    # extract pre-processed dataset under the `data` directory.
```

As discussed above, the key difference of our version of the pre-processed data and the original ones used in Liang et al. (2018) is that we did not anonymize named entities in questions.  

## Usage

The following command demos training a MAPO model using BERT (`bert-base-uncased`) as the representation learning layer:
```bash
conda activate tabert

OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python -m \
  table.experiments \
  train \
  seed 0 \
  --cuda \
  --work-dir=runs/demo_run \
  --config=data/config/config.vanilla_bert.json
```

Training BERT requires at least two GPUs, one for the `learner` to perform asynchronous gradient updates, and another one for `actor`s to perform sampling. Since each `actor` maintains its own copy of BERT, running this model requires large GPU memory. In our experiments we used 8x 16GB V100 GPUs.

To improve GPU memory efficiency, the model also includes a`BERT server` mode, which allows all actors to share a single BERT model hosted on GPU, while the remaining parameters of `actor`s are hosted on CPU. This significantly reduces memory usage, and the model could be trained on two 1080 GPUs with 11GB memory each. However, since gradient updates of all `actor`s and the centralized BERT model are performed asynchronously, this might result in marginal performance drop. To enable the BERT server mode, simply change the  `actor_use_table_bert_proxy` property to `true` in the config file:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python -m \
  table.experiments \
  train \
  seed 0 \
  --cuda \
  --work-dir=runs/demo_run \
  --config=data/config/config.vanilla_bert.json \
  --extra-config='{"actor_use_table_bert_proxy": true}'
```

To perform evaluation with a trained model:
```bash
python -m table.experiments.py \
  test \
  --cuda \
  --model runs/demo_run/model.best.bin \
  --test-file data/wikitable_questions/wtq_preprocess_0805_no_anonymize_ent/test_split.json \
```
